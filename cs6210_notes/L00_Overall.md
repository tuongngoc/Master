**Apr-02-2014 10:43 :** As of today, I have 34 calendar days including 5/6.
That breaks down to:
	- weekend days: 5 x 2 = 10
	- weekdays    : 24

@ 4 hrs per weekday and 6.2 hrs per weekend day, this can be done.

Journal
-------

**Mar-13-2014 08:52 :** Some thoughts on note taking:
- in a blank md file, start with h1 lecture title, h2 resources, h2 todos, h2 plan and h2 journal
- log start of lecture in journal
- update resources list
	- add videos to resource list
	- find all papers that may apply and add to resource list
	- find all piazza comments related to this topic and add to resource list (assuming you're late for this lecture in pacing)

- update plan
	- put estimate for video watching (based on duration reported in udacity wiki)
	- put estimate for paper reading
	- put estimate for quiz answering online
	- put estimate for question and answers - online and on piazza.
	- put estimate for note consolidation
	- ... and therefore total estimate of hours required.
- watch the videos	
	- Create h2 section for each main topic in video
	- watch video once without break
	- watch video again with breaks
	- write notes with timestamps for important notes
	- write answers to quizzes in line
	- organize notes into coherent set of bullets
	- review notes for all topics in lecture to date.
- read the papers
	- create h2 section for each paper
	- read paper once without break
	- write down why this paper is pertinent.
